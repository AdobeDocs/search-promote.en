# About the My Profile menu{#about-the-my-profile-menu}

Use the My Profile menu to set personal information, preferences, login password, and view access privileges.

## Configuring your personal user information {#task_A11A3BE2527B4204B896E04303B04AA6}

You can view and manage your personal user information associated with your account including setting your required email address and the character encoding that is used by the majority of your website pages.

<!-- 

t_configuring_your_personal_user_information.xml

 -->

The character encoding that you select is applied to the web pages in your account as long as they do not specify an overriding character set encoding in a meta tag. The character encoding is also applied to the account configuration pages. The default value is "Western European (ISO-8859-1).

When you specify the email address it must contain ASCII characters only. Use standard alphabetic (a..z) characters or numeric (0..9) characters with exactly one '@' character used to separate the user name from the domain. The characters '_', '+', '-', '.', '!', '#', '$', ''', '%', '&', '&#42;', '=', '?', '^', '{', and '}' are also allowed. Your email address cannot start with a period ('.') character.

## Viewing your access privileges {#task_6107C5BA333B4053A56325AE5E3A1848}

With My Access Privileges you can use roles to restrict access to pages or remove rarely used pages. The access privileges shows what roles you belong to, if any. If you are not currently assigned to one or more roles then you have full unrestricted access.

<!-- 

t_viewing_your_searchpromote_access_privileges.xml

 -->

The tree view shows you the pages in the member-center that can be restricted and whether you currently have access to that page as denoted by a check mark.

See [Adding a new role to an account](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-users-menu.md#task_E148D02275DE4F899BA79736A29895AB).

See [Viewing the roles that exist for an account](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-users-menu.md#task_4EAE1D018F384691A083AD51E5CE58DC).

The privilege **[!UICONTROL Can push live]** in the tree view is a special control that grants any user in that role the ability to push any staged item live. By creating a role that does not have this ability you can ensure that users in that role are not able to impact your live search until someone with the ability to push the settings live reviews their work and does so.

The privileges **[!UICONTROL Run live indexes]** and **[!UICONTROL Run stage indexes]** are special controls that are used to grant or deny users within a role the ability to run an index.

For example, you may have some users in a role that have the ability to run staged indexes but not live indexes or the ability to push staged setting live. Users in this role can test all of their work in a staged environment without impacting the live index. Some settings require you to rebuild the index before you can preview the changes that were made.

To change your access privileges, you must change the privileges for the appropriate role in the administrator area.
