# About the Users menu{#about-the-users-menu}

Use the Users menu to view and add users, view and add roles, or change role membership. You must be a site search/merchandising user with administrator privileges to perform any of the tasks on the Users menu.

## Viewing account users {#task_FDDF30EE23C548DF8CFBB2FB2605303C}

You can use the [!UICONTROL View Users] page to view all existing account users. You can also remove account users (except for the account owner).

<!-- 

t_viewing_account_users.xml

 -->

Only account users with **[!UICONTROL User Admin]** checked can remove users or modify user roles.

Before you can remove an account owner, transfer the account ownership to another user.

After you have transferred ownership, you can remove an account like any other user. Removed users receive an e-mail that notifies them of the change in status.

See [Transferring account ownership to another account user](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-account-options-menu.md#task_47E3C66CC6374274830DA10171E0CF17).

>[!NOTE]
>
>You must be a site search/merchandising user with Administrator privileges to perform this task.

**To view account users** 

1. On the product menu, click **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Users]** > **[!UICONTROL View Users]**.
1. (Optional) Under the [!UICONTROL User Admin?] column heading, select account users whom you want to give the ability to remove account users or edit account user roles.
1. (Optional) Under the [!UICONTROL Remove?] column heading, select account users whom you want to remove.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Changes]**.
1. (Optional) Click a hyperlinked role name on the [!UICONTROL View Users] page. The [!UICONTROL Role Membership] page is opened where you can assign users to roles or you can unassign users from roles.

   See [Configuring role membership](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-users-menu.md#task_DAC596AAFFCE4EF0BE68CEEF7E365414). 

## Adding account users {#task_176C463A0C0849B29245C28EC9876326}

You can use the [!UICONTROL Add Users] page to add new account users to site search/merchandising.

<!-- 

t_adding_account_users.xml

 -->

Only the new user's e-mail address is required. When the new user is added to the account, the new user is sent the account information.

By default a new user is not assigned as a User Administrator. User Administrator's can define and edit roles, and remove other users. You can choose to make a new user a User Administrator from the [!UICONTROL Add Users] page. Or, you can use the View Users page to make the new user a User Administrator.

See [Viewing account users](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-users-menu.md#task_FDDF30EE23C548DF8CFBB2FB2605303C).

The e-mail address that you specify must contain ASCII characters only. Use standard alphabetic (a..z) characters or numeric (0..9) characters with exactly one '@' character used to separate the user name from the domain. The characters '_', '+', '-', '.', '!', '#', '$', ''', '%', '&', '&#42;', '=', '?', '^', '{', and '}' are also allowed. Do not start the e-mail address with '.'

If the new user is not an Adobe customer already, you are prompted to create a customer login for that person. The new user is sent a login password and confirmation. When the new user logs in for the first time, they fill out a customer profile.

You can optionally click a hyperlinked role name on the [!UICONTROL Add Users] page. The [!UICONTROL Role Membership] page is opened where you can assign users to roles or you can unassign users from roles.

See [Configuring role membership](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-users-menu.md#task_DAC596AAFFCE4EF0BE68CEEF7E365414).

>[!NOTE]
>
>You must be a site search/merchandising user with Administrator privileges to perform this task.

**To add account users** 

1. On the product menu, click **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Users]** > **[!UICONTROL Add Users]**.
1. On the [!UICONTROL Add Users] page, in the [!UICONTROL User's Email] field and the [!UICONTROL User's Email (again)] fields, enter the e-mail address of the new user.
1. (Optional) Check **[!UICONTROL User Administrator]** to give the new account user the ability to remove account users or edit account user roles.
1. In the [!UICONTROL Roles for this User] table, check the roles that you want to assign to the new account user.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add User]**.

## Viewing the roles that exist for an account {#task_4EAE1D018F384691A083AD51E5CE58DC}

You can use the [!UICONTROL View Roles] page to show all the roles that currently exist for the currently logged in account.

<!-- 

t_viewing_the_roles_that_exist_for_an_account.xml

 -->

If no roles exist for the account, the user interface informs you of this issue. You can use Add Roles to create and add a role.

See [Adding a new role to an account](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-users-menu.md#task_E148D02275DE4F899BA79736A29895AB).

Removing a role does not delete account users that are assigned to it.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You must be a site search/merchandising user with Administrator privileges to perform this task.

**To view the roles that exist for an account** 

1. On the product menu, click **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Users]** > **[!UICONTROL View Roles]**.

  See [Editing a role](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-users-menu.md#task_13875C2464034CE387285640412E1B59).

## Editing a role {#task_13875C2464034CE387285640412E1B59}

You can rename a existing role, change its description, and select just the areas of the user interface to which you want to give the role access.

<!-- 

t_editing_a_role.xml

See [Adding a new role to an account](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-users-menu.md#task_E148D02275DE4F899BA79736A29895AB).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Changes]**.

## Adding a new role to an account {#task_E148D02275DE4F899BA79736A29895AB}

You can use the [!UICONTROL Add Roles] page to make the assignment of permissions to account users easier and faster.

<!-- 

t_adding_a_new_role_to_an_account.xml

 -->

For example, you could individually grant each member of your Public Relations department access to site search/merchandising tasks. However, it is much more efficient to add these users to a "PR" role and then assign the tasks to the entire role.

Each role name must be unique. You can use alphanumeric characters and common symbols, including dashes "-", underscores "_", and periods "." . The name cannot begin with either an underscore or a period.

Under the [!UICONTROL Users in This Role] column header in the table, you can optionally click a hyperlinked e-mail address of a user. The [!UICONTROL Role Membership] page is opened for the specific user where you can assign the user to roles or you can unassign the user from roles.

See [Configuring role membership](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-users-menu.md#task_DAC596AAFFCE4EF0BE68CEEF7E365414).

Under the [!UICONTROL Roles] column header in the table, you can optionally click a hyperlinked role name. The [!UICONTROL Role Membership] page is opened where you can assign users to the selected role or you can unassign users from the selected role.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You must be a site search/merchandising user with Administrator privileges to perform this task.

**To add a new role to an account** 

1. On the product menu, click **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Users]** > **[!UICONTROL Add Roles]**.
1. On the [!UICONTROL Add Roles] page, in the [!UICONTROL Role Name] field, enter the name of the role.
1. (Optional) In the [!UICONTROL Description] field, enter a sentence that adequately describes the role.
1. Select which users belong to the role by checking the boxes to the left of each e-mail address.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Role]**.

## Configuring role membership {#task_DAC596AAFFCE4EF0BE68CEEF7E365414}

You can use the [!UICONTROL Role Membership] page to add users to a role or remove users from a role.

<!-- 

t_configuring_role_membership.xml

 -->

You can also manage individual user group memberships when you view roles by user.
