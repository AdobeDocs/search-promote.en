# Getting Started{#getting-started}

If you are new to Searc&Promote and dynamic navigation, start here to get up and running with your account. Among other things, you will learn how to index your website, and customize the look and feel of your search results.

## Configuring your account {#section_FD4C71A422BD4ACEA51AFC98CDD3211C}

Before you begin to customize your account, change the password that was initially assigned to you.

See [Changing your login password](c-about-settings-menu/c-about-my-profile-menu.md#task_F5FF13AAD1514FE997C8882D4537C0C9).

You should also add or edit your personal settings such as character set encoding, contact information, email address, and preferences.

See [Configuring your personal user information](c-about-settings-menu/c-about-my-profile-menu.md#task_A11A3BE2527B4204B896E04303B04AA6).

See [Configuring your preferences](c-about-settings-menu/c-about-my-profile-menu.md#task_5E06BF565C284C2EBBE18E10A1C4BFBB).

When you have finished with your personal settings, open your account-wide settings.

See [Configuring your account settings](c-about-settings-menu/c-about-account-options-menu.md#task_80A38D0C8E4F453395BD67B81E4B45D9).

Review your account name and website address, and then select a time zone to use for reports and scheduling. The website address you enter is the main site "entrypoint" for your site. All pages below the entrypoint are crawled and indexed if they are linked, directly or indirectly, to the specified URL. For example, if the entrypoint is `https://www.mysite.com/`, the page `https://www.mysite.com/news/04.html` is indexed, if it is linked from the main `index.html` page or a page that is linked from that index. If your website contains sections that are not linked from the main entrypoint, such as pages on a second domain, you can specify additional URL entrypoints.

See [Adding multiple URL entry points that you want indexed](c-about-settings-menu/c-about-crawling-menu.md#task_2338A47387D74CFDAC4D4EF4A367ED45).

## Adding the sample search form code to your web pages {#section_2BC00BE7D81245188E4A89E09D41D387}

You are now ready to add the search code to your web pages. Sample form code is provided for a standard Search form.

See [Previewing the search form as it would appear on your...](c-about-auto-complete.md#task_437B35EFA5424603A08AF8E79E6B4714).

See [Copying the HTML code of the search form into the...](c-about-auto-complete.md#task_A3A01EA800F24C0AA33902387E0362C7).

Copy and paste the code into your web pages wherever you want a search form to appear. For example, many websites place a form on their home page, or in a navigation frame. You can edit the form code to suit your design and content needs, or add additional search parameters.

## Customizing your search results link {#section_0B4E2D6E1A3E4D3FBDBB607260CDB111}

You can optionally customize your search results link, background colors, and header information.

See [About Templates](c-about-design-menu/c-about-templates.md#concept_06EB481B14864E18A8AE2BCD1D6EF0B5).

See [Adding a new presentation or transport template file](c-about-design-menu/c-about-templates.md#task_73199757B6E748CAA604902FF913F012).

See [Editing a presentation or a transport template](c-about-design-menu/c-about-templates.md#task_800E0E2265C34C028C92FEB5A1243EC3).

When you satisfied with the appearance of the template, save your changes, and then click **[!UICONTROL Push Live]**.

See [Running a full index of a live or staged website...](c-about-index-menu/c-about-full-index.md#task_F7FE04D8A1654A7787FCCA31B45EB42D).

## Indexing your website {#section_6BBD16929CF04CB2A78BD657681C06B8}

Your website is indexed when you first create an account. However, if you have added new content or edit existing content, reindex your website.

See [Running a full index of a live or staged website...](c-about-index-menu/c-about-full-index.md#task_F7FE04D8A1654A7787FCCA31B45EB42D).

You can also schedule regular index times.

See [Setting the full index schedule for a live website](c-about-index-menu/c-about-full-index.md#task_6760F3256D004A228B38968DF15421F0).

See [Running an incremental index of a live or staged website...](c-about-index-menu/c-about-incremental-index.md#task_9BFB6157F3884B2FAECB7E0E9CA318CB).

If your website is large, or if you want to reindex only a set of frequently changed pages, you can configure and then perform an incremental index instead.

See [Configuring an incremental index of a staged website](c-about-index-menu/c-about-incremental-index.md#task_46A367B0786C4C90BFFA5D3F95FD86C0).

See [Running an incremental index of a live or staged website...](c-about-index-menu/c-about-incremental-index.md#task_9BFB6157F3884B2FAECB7E0E9CA318CB).

To perform an incremental index without having to log in, you can create a scripted index.

See [Configuring a scripted incremental index](c-about-index-menu/c-about-scripted-index.md#task_05AE040FE75E40FFAA5E10B6B6D4D255).

Or, you can use a script to pass a remote request for indexing.

See [Configuring Remote Control for indexing](c-about-index-menu/c-about-remote-control-for-indexing.md#task_57C296258404448DA7A5ADC9B7232391).

## Viewing search term reports {#section_1F4A7F57B9C64FBDA5E3E592621BF6F4}

Visitors' search queries are logged and reports are created for you by day, week, and month. These queries let you see what your customers are looking for, how often they succeed, and where your website navigation breaks down.

See [Viewing the Terms Report or the Null Search Terms Report...](c-about-reports-menu/c-about-reports-menu.md#task_53B7ED1582DD4B0E8376546A7AFC789A).

## Advanced tasks for customizing the search experience {#section_036286EC316F47C89D0D50C2D061BB59}

There are many additional options that let you completely customize and control your customer's search experience.

* Control which portions of your site are, and are not, indexed with URL Masks.

  See [About URL Masks](c-about-settings-menu/c-about-crawling-menu.md#concept_8039DFC53FF3410AA494D602F71BA164). 
* Include or exclude files based on their dates.

  See [About Date Masks](c-about-settings-menu/c-about-crawling-menu.md#concept_F4F1F58A646F4A86B8650EC46FDCEF66). 
* If your website includes PDF documents or files with other content types such as MP3 files or Microsoft Office files, you can choose to index or not index such files.

  See [About Content Types](c-about-settings-menu/c-about-crawling-menu.md#concept_6FEA1355C0374500B4C53090C34A8A07). 
* You can also provide passwords so that site search/merchandising can access password-protected areas of your website for searching.

  See [About Passwords](c-about-settings-menu/c-about-crawling-menu.md#concept_3EDBD731725D46B891F834D4472774DC). 
* Control the number of connections that are used to index your website.

  See [About Connections](c-about-settings-menu/c-about-crawling-menu.md#concept_E2F3B7E7521147479E5948A94BB3A40B). 
* Provide information about forms that you want crawled and submitted.

  See [About Form Submission](c-about-settings-menu/c-about-crawling-menu.md#concept_CADD5D7CF373497DAA6F8564D7BC8502). 
* Exclude common words such as "a" or "the" from searches.

  See [About Excluded Words](c-about-linguistics-menu/c-about-excluded-words.md#concept_9DB67BD2F0DC43AC88741003D9F39812). 
* Specify certain areas of your website to search, such as "News Section" or "Travel Section".

  See [About Collections](c-about-settings-menu/c-about-searching-menu.md#concept_62E42ACE53D54EEE9273433B86259127). 
* Customize your search for use with framesets.

  See [Using frames with forms](c-appendices/c-searchforms.md#reference_82CDDDA1E37042E4849EBF7EA05407C5). 
* Control the locations from which a search is initiated.

  See [About Restrictions](c-about-settings-menu/c-about-searching-menu.md#concept_B5B527E04EBF4E9AB5956EEF881DDBF1). 
* Specify the values that are used when you test templates internally.

  See [About Preview](c-about-settings-menu/c-about-searching-menu.md#concept_DF293FD3B02C467F8842C8C21D62F294). 
* Metadata options let you customize the relevance of the HTML and meta fields (such as keywords or the document body) that are considered when a customer submits a search query. You can customize and define metadata fields.

  See [About Definitions](c-about-settings-menu/c-about-metadata-menu.md#concept_AE48035C210145169BE067D396975620). 
* Alter the content of pre-defined fields. For example, you can append new content, such as "On Sale Now!") to the `desc` meta tags of a page or group of pages. Or, you can remove irrelevant content without altering your actual web pages.

  See [About Injections](c-about-settings-menu/c-about-metadata-menu.md#concept_DA091920671948A0A893A26B3A2FAAE5). 

* Use the options under **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Filtering]** and **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Rewrite Rules]** to "rewrite" page content before it is indexed. 

* Configure dictionaries to let you specify groups of related words (for example, purchase, buy, and procure). These related words help to return relevant results even when a customer's search query does not exactly match the terminology that is used on your web pages. With the synonym used in the above example, a customer's search query of "purchase" returns pages that contain the word "buy."

  See [About Dictionaries](c-about-linguistics-menu/c-about-dictionaries.md#concept_B8028B71EC8144669614C64578EDB034).
