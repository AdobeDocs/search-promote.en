# Using the History option{#using-the-history-option}

You can use History to review a list of all the revisions that were made to an implemented feature such as a facet, breadcrumb, banner, or template, to name a few.

History shows you the following for a given feature:

* Version number of the revision. 
* Email address of the account user who changed the options or settings of a feature. 
* Date that the change was made. 
* Type of save that was made.

You can also use [!DNL History] to revert to a previously applied change that was made to the feature. The entry with a **bold** version value represents the current version and is always at the top of the list.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The History option is not available for all features.

**To use the History option** 

1. Depending on the feature you are currently using, click **[!UICONTROL History]** in the upper-right corner of the page or window that is currently open.
1. (Optional) In the History window, do any of the following:

    * Set the number of revisions that you want to show per page from the Show drop-down list.
    * Click a hyperlinked version number to revert the settings in the feature to a specific date.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Close]**.
