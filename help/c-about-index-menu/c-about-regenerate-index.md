# About Regenerate Index{#about-regenerate-index}

You can use Regenerate Index to update your website's index without the need to re-crawl your site.

## About Regenerate Index {#concept_6CBE6B8D18EF47D293091CBA542245FA}

You can use [!DNL Regenerate Index] to update your website's index without the need to re-crawl your site. 

You can use this option whenever you make a change to the following account options:

* Words & Languages 
* Excluded Words 
* Synonyms 
* Metadata settings such as when you delete a metadata field, change a field name, data type, date formats, sort order, minimum or maximum rank value, default rank value, list type, or list separator.

The updated account option information is used to generate a new site index. Regenerate lets you quickly and efficiently make changes to your site index.

By default, any new or changed website content is not included in the index. To include such content, run a full or incremental index.
