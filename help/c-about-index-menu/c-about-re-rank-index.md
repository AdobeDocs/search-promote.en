# About Re-Rank Index{#about-re-rank-index}

You can use [!DNL Re-Rank Index] to update your site's ranking information without the need to recrawl your site.

## Using Re-Rank Index {#concept_147B0A9FCD51451787DA898E06F7C692}

You can use this option whenever you make changes to certain account Ranking settings. The updated account option information is used to generate new site ranking data. Re-Rank lets you quickly and efficiently make changes to your site ranking.

By default, any new or changed website content is not included in the index. To include such content, run a full or incremental index.

See [Running a full index of a live or staged website...](../c-about-index-menu/c-about-full-index.md#task_F7FE04D8A1654A7787FCCA31B45EB42D).

See [Running an incremental index of a live or staged website...](../c-about-index-menu/c-about-incremental-index.md#task_9BFB6157F3884B2FAECB7E0E9CA318CB).
