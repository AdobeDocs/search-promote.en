# About Simulator{#about-simulator}

Use Simulator to see what your search would look like if you were to push everything that is currently staged, live.

## About Simulator {#concept_020AA6751E32421A96A3455508364C7E}

Use Simulator to see what your search would look like if you were to push everything that is currently staged, live. 

You can also simulate your current live search for comparison purposes. Simulator has a built-in debugger to show you which business rules are firing for a given search. If you uncheck any associated rule, Simulator re-simulates your site's search as if that rule did not exist. Rules are listed from highest priority to lowest priority, where higher priority rules trump lower priority rules.

See also [Adding a new business rule](c-about-rules-menu/c-about-business-rules.md#task_BD3B31ED48BB4B1B8F1DCD3BFA2528E7).
