# Search&Promote 8.17.0 Release Notes (10/30/2014){#search-promote-release-notes}

## New features {#section_2A10EF6B40FC4F2CB2381FFA9FFA64BD}

* Debugging of the simulator - provides additional information concerning the placement of each individual visible search result. 
* Tags for business rules - Added ability to tag business rules with specific labels thereby letting you filter for rules that match a given label.

  See [About Business Rules](../c-about-rules-menu/c-about-business-rules.md#concept_2A93D76216754D3D8412CDEA00BD26BD).

## Fixes and enhancements {#section_22D1AFC99F394D569898828A0D3C419D}

* Vertical update-based re-ranking - faster re-ranking of the index now results in performance that is better representative of what your real web traffic experiences.

  See [About Re-Rank Index](../c-about-index-menu/c-about-re-rank-index.md#concept_147B0A9FCD51451787DA898E06F7C692). 

* When **[!UICONTROL Ignore Apostrophes]** and **[!UICONTROL Ignore Hyphens]** is enabled in **[!UICONTROL Linguistics]** > **[!UICONTROL Words & Language]**, Auto-complete now removes apostrophes and hyphens from the query data as expected.

  See [About Words & Language](../c-about-linguistics-menu/c-about-words-and-language.md#concept_CEB4B9576F3C4E2EB87B352EEC738D79) and [About Auto-Complete](../c-about-auto-complete.md#concept_093A9CD754864BA79B456FE4BEB64578). 

* Process monitor now restarts apache processes. 
* Implemented a "Reveal Facet Item" action in Business Rules. 
* On the [!DNL Adjust Ranking Weights] page, you now have the ability to adjust the **[!UICONTROL Rule & Relevancy Balance]** setting in 1% increments.

  See [Adjusting the weight associated with ranking rules](../c-about-rules-menu/c-about-ranking-rules.md#task_3CB6FC92A66F4D99874A42D55825DB64). 

* Apache was crashing with Kindle Fire's Silk browser user-agent. 
* An indexing failure issue was fixed.
