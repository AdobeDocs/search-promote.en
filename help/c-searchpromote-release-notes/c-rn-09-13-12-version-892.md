# Search&amp;Promote 8.9.2 Release Notes (09/13/2012){#search-promote-release-notes}

 **Fixes and enhancements**

* You can now automatically push banners live when business rules are pushed live. 
* Fixed an issue where search counts in parent nested facets were inaccurate. 
* Fixed an issue where business rules stopped working on either [!DNL Staging] or [!DNL Live] after being edited, pushed live, and then followed with a full live index. 

* Business rule triggers are now combined to reduce the number of rules.

  See the table of options in [Adding a new business rule](../c-about-rules-menu/c-about-business-rules.md#task_BD3B31ED48BB4B1B8F1DCD3BFA2528E7). 
* Fixed an issue where edited business rules remained broken for approximately ten seconds after the rule was pushed live. 
* Fixed an issue where if you pushed business rules live during a live indexing operation, any edited business rules became non-functional after the indexing operation completed. 
* You can now reset the **[!UICONTROL to rank]** field value on the [!DNL Edit Pre-Search Rule] page.

  See [Editing a pre-search rule](../c-about-rules-menu/c-about-pre-search-rules.md#task_25F77050C5DA42B29DFD1C9718FB8C64).
