# Search&Promote 8.8.1 Release Notes (05/31/2012){#search-promote-release-notes}

 **Fixes and enhancements**

* Pagination was missing the next link when there was more than 1000 results and the totals were comma separated. 
* Pagination was displaying GSPAGENAVPLACEHOLDER in the search results instead to the actual pagination. 
* Removed footer from the Visual Rule Builder. 
* Breadcrumbs now use facet slots display name instead of the abstract slot facet name. 
* Adobe Scene7: You can now edit a parameter the second time around. 
* Facet slots display name did not come back properly when the facet is a sticky facet (or multi-select) and is selected. 
* `<search-description>` tag showed the body instead when the metatag for the description had empty content. 
* Exposed Guided Search Requests under Reports > Search Requests.
