# About Alerts{#about-alerts}

The Alerts page provides a central place to view and manage all alerts having to do with your account.

## Using Alerts {#concept_B731210A050A4AB1A7F4C809AA8B5355} 

A variety of alerts are generated, sent to one or more e-mail addresses. The filters and other controls on the Alerts page can help you manage multiple alerts at once.

Each alert has one of the following three levels which are represented by different icons:

* Info-level alerts are the most common type of alert. They show non-critical information that is helpful or that you may want to be aware of. 
* Warning-level alerts indicate a situation that you should take care of or monitor. 
* Urgent alerts, though rare, provide information about issues that you must take care of immediately.

Above the list of alerts, a bar contains filtering and navigation controls. If you have many alerts, you may want to filter them based on any combination of level, date, destination e-mail address, or subject text. You can also filter items by date, the person they were sent to, and by subject.

Select one or more filter buttons to show those levels of alerts, or deselect them to filter out those items. To filter by date, select a start date, end date, or both, in MM/DD/YYYY format. Enter text in the "Sent To" or "Subject" fields to find alerts that match the text you entered.
