# About Words & Language{#about-words-language}

You can use [!DNL Words & Language] to determine how search terms are matched to the content of your web pages.

## Using Words & Language {#concept_CEB4B9576F3C4E2EB87B352EEC738D79}

Before the effects of [!DNL Words & Language] settings are available to site visitors, including any changes you make to those settings, you must regenerate your site index. Regenerating, unlike indexing, does not involve crawling your web pages and takes only a few seconds. 

## Configuring how search terms are matched to your web content {#task_351A9144A51F4B41923BDBACDEF3B616}

You can use Words & Language to determine how site search/merchandising matches search terms to the content of your web pages.

      <td colname="col1"> <p>Partial Alphanumeric Matching </p> </td> 
      <td colname="col2"> <p>Not selected by default. </p> <p>When selected, this option lets you split tokens on alphabetical-numerical transitions to allow free-text matches on part or product tokens. </p> <p>For example, suppose that you have a product identifier of <span class="codeph"> 910XT </span> in the body content of one or more pages on a website. When this option is <i>not</i> selected, <span class="keyword"> Adobe Search&amp;Promote </span> finds matches for this product identifier when searching for <span class="codeph"> 910XT </span>. And, with <span class="uicontrol"> Search Concat-Div-Enable </span> turned on, <span class="keyword"> Adobe Search&amp;Promote </span> would also find <span class="codeph"> 910 XT </span>. However, it would not find instances of <span class="codeph"> 910 </span> or <span class="codeph"> XT </span> exclusively. </p> <p>When you select <span class="uicontrol"> Partial Alphanumeric Matching </span>, the indexer breaks these mixed alphanumeric tokens into multiple tokens. For example, a product identifier such as <span class="codeph"> XYZ123 </span> is indexed into three tokens: <span class="codeph"> XYZ123 </span>, <span class="codeph"> XYZ </span>, and <span class="codeph"> 123 </span>. Such functionality allows for search-time free-text matching on any of these variants. </p> <p>In another example, suppose that you have the product identifier <span class="codeph"> AB910XT </span>. If you select <span class="uicontrol"> Partial Alphanumeric Matching </span> <i>and</i> have <span class="uicontrol"> Search Concat-Div-Enable </span> turned on, <span class="keyword"> Adobe Search&amp;Promote </span> indexes it as <span class="codeph"> AB910XT </span>, <span class="codeph"> AB </span>, <span class="codeph"> 910 </span>, and <span class="codeph"> XT </span>. Then, when a user searches for <span class="codeph"> 910XT </span>, for example, the search expands to also find instances of <span class="codeph"> 910XT </span>, <span class="codeph"> 910 </span>, or <span class="codeph"> XT </span>. </p> <p> <p>Note:  <span class="uicontrol"> Search Concat-Div-Enable </span> is not enabled by default. Contact Technical Support to activate the feature for your use. </p> </p> <p> <p>Note:  <span class="uicontrol"> Partial Alphanumeric Matching </span> is applied globally to all indexed fields. However, it only affects free-text matching; it does not affect exact matching or range matching. </p> </p> </td>
